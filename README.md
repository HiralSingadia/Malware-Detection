# Overview
We present an analytic study on malware prediction in windows machines having certain traits. We examined a kaggle data set provided by Microsoft, which was taken from their client base. We first implemented a base model using decision trees and SVM, then went on to more complex algorithms like LightGBM, Fast and Frugal Trees and Neural Nets. We found that the Neural Net performs better in terms of Accuracy, and one of the features FFTs peforms splits on is AvSigVersion which confirms our hypothesis that machines with a lower version of Windows Defender are more likely to get a malware.
